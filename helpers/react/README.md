# Setting Up the React App

Before running the app, make sure you have the correct versions of Node and npm installed.

## Check Your Versions

Run the following commands in your terminal to confirm:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Install or Switch to the Correct Versions

If your versions don’t match the project requirements, use a version manager like nvm to install and switch:
```bash
nvm install 23.11.0
nvm use 23.11.0
```

## Install Project Dependencies

Once you’re on the correct versions, install all required packages:

npm install

## Start the React App

After the installation completes, start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the React app locally — usually at:
http://localhost:5173

If the port number differs, check your terminal output for the correct URL.
